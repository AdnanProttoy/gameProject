# Blackjack Game in Python

This is a simple Blackjack game that I made using Python. It runs in the terminal and lets you play 3 rounds against the computer (dealer).

## How It Works

- Both player and dealer get 2 cards (random numbers between 1 and 11).
- One of the dealer’s cards is hidden at first.
- You can choose to “hit” (take another card) or “stay” (keep your cards).
- If your total goes over 21, you lose.
- If you get exactly 21, you win.
- After you stay, the dealer’s total is shown and compared to yours to decide the winner.

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Save the file as `blackjack.py`.
3. Open a terminal and run:

```bash
python blackjack.py
